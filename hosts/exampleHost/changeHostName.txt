How to set hostname for a host.

You need to change the host name in three different places.

Place 1.

./flake.nix

Change

    exampleHost = mkHost "exampleHost" "x86_64-linux";

to

    myHost = mkHost "myHost" "x86_64-linux";

Place 2.

Move directory

    ./hosts/exampleHost

to

    ./hosts/myHost

Place 3.

./hosts/exampleHost/default.nix

Change

  networking.hostName = "exampleHost";

to

  networking.hostName = "myHost";

End.
